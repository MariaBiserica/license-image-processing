Digital Image Quality Assessment and Editing - Backend

This backend component is developed in Python and uses the Flask framework to handle the application's logic, including estimating digital image quality using various no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) algorithms. Leveraging both deep learning and traditional methods, the backend provides comprehensive evaluations of image quality without needing a reference image. Key features include:

Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to implement deep learning models, specifically the VGG16 neural network, for robust image quality evaluation.

Comprehensive Quality Metrics: Implements traditional NR-IQA algorithms like BRISQUE, NIQE, and IL-NIQE alongside custom algorithms that assess individual image features such as brightness, contrast, noise levels, clarity, and chromatic quality.

Batch Assessment and Ranking: Supports batch processing for simultaneous evaluation of large image sets, automatically ranking images by quality to help users quickly identify the highest or lowest quality images and generate detailed classifications.

API Integration with Firebase: Designed to work in conjunction with Firebase services for data handling and storage, leveraging Firestore for secure data management, real-time synchronization, and event-driven triggers for notifications.

Image Editing Capabilities: Based on quality assessments, the backend offers editing features that allow for noise reduction, contrast enhancement, color adjustments, and more. Specific editing tools Gaussian blur, edge detection, color space conversion, histogram equalization, and morphological transformations. These tools enable interactive and intuitive image enhancements directly informed by the quality evaluations.

This backend is optimized for high performance, scalability, and flexibility. The advanced feature assessments, batch processing, and comprehensive editing capabilities make it a powerful tool for image quality analysis and optimization.
